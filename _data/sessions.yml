  title: "Happy little benefactor: Prosocial behaviors promotes happiness in toddlers"
  description: "The origin of prosocial behavior has long been debated.  Over the past decade, evidence that toddlers display more happiness when sharing rather than receiving treats has been used to support the argument that humans, by nature, are prosocial. However, sharing is rare and inconsistent at this age, implying that the emotional rewards of sharing might have their origins or be affected by social factors, such as praise. In addition, whether this “warm glow” is specific for sharing behavior, or also the case for other prosocial behaviors (e.g., helping and comforting) is unclear. By replicating (using the same task) and extending previous studies (varying the number of resources and examining praise),  113 Dutch toddlers (M = 21.64 months, SD = 3.33 months, 59 boys) participated in a sharing task in which they received 8, 4 or 2 treats, followed by instrumental helping and comforting tasks (for the latter two tasks the toddlers were praised if they helped or comforted).  Toddlers were videotaped during the experiment and happiness later coded. In total, 79 toddlers at least shared, helped or comforted once in the experiment. For these children, results showed that: (1) for sharing, consistent with previous findings, toddlers display more happiness when giving than receiving treats, although the number of resources did not affect toddlers’ happiness. (2) for instrumental helping, toddlers displayed more happiness after helping, and their happiness did not increase after been rewarded (praised). (3) for comforting, toddlers displayed less happiness after witnessing experimenter’s emotional distress (feeling cold), but not more happiness after helping or being praised. Taken together, these results indicate that both sharing and instrumental helping are emotionally rewarding independent of praise, supporting a  biological origin of these behaviors."

  title: "Money is sweet when it says I love you"
  description: "Money is not appreciated as a gift, partly because money lacks social meanings that express care to the receiver. We tested an idea that money can turn to be acceptable when its amount signals a social meaning. Specifically, Study 1 showed that Chinese appreciate 520RMB cash more than both 500RMB and 550RMB as a Valentine’s Day gift, when 520 means I Love You in Chinese. In Study 2 we found that Chinese receivers chose 520RMB over 530RMB as a birthday gift. This preference for a lower but meaningful amount is particularly salient when it comes from close others."

  title: "A dynamic brain network model of interaction between emotion processing and executive function"
  description: "Emotion processing and executive function serve as two crucial cognitive aspects, they interact and influence each other like the south and north pole in the Tai Chi framework. However, it remains largely unknown about what dynamic brain networks support flexible emotion processing and executive function such as working memory, especially interaction between them. Separate activation in amygdala and prefrontal cortex have been long thought to contribute to these processes. However, emerging dynamic brain network studies have begun to examine how dynamics of brain networks support flexible emotion processing, executive function and interaction between them. Focusing on this central issue, in several imaging studies, we used the ‘state of the art’ resting- and task-state fMRI connectivity and network-based approaches, seeking to build a dynamic brain network model of how emotion is processed and how emotion impacts cognitive computations in working memory. Our series of results indicate that dynamic interaction between the salience network (SN), the executive control network (ECN), the default mode network (DMN) and sensory networks enables dynamic representation of emotion (i.e. anxiety and stress) and supports flexible cognitive computation in WM and their dynamic interaction. Previous influential studies suggest that neural oscillation across multiple bands and locus coeruleus (LC)-norepinephrine (NE) neuromodulator serve as potential mechanisms underlying dynamic signal synergy among brain networks, further enable flexible interaction between emotion processing and executive function. Taken together, human brain is a highly complex and dynamic machine, which supports a number of flexible and sophisticated functions including emotion processing and executive functions. Our findings point out a dynamic brain network model, which will shed a light on understanding how complex dynamic brain systems empower flexible cognitive functions."

  title: "Catecholaminergic modulation of the semantic processing in sentence comprehension"
  description: "Catecholamine (CA) neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine) have long been implicated playing a critical role in executive control and decision making. Recently, evidence from neurodegenerative patients and healthy population suggested that CA also modulates language processing. However, the question of what kind of influence the CA might exert on language is still open. My recent study investigated this question by examining the effects of methylphenidate (MPH), which is a CA agonist, on EEG response related to language processing. The results demonstrated a clear neuropharmacological effect that CA neurotransmitters provide a relevance signal that enhances semantic integration operations, regardless of whether language processing is goal-relevant or not. The Basal Ganglia projections to Frontal Cortex might mediate the language processing effects of these neuropharmacological agents. These results contradicted the general hypothesis that CA promotes goal-relevant processes, while inhibiting goal-irrelevant information, suggesting that our capacity for language is a core system rooted in our biological system."
