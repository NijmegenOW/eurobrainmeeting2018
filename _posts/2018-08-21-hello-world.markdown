We're very excited - not just because of the launch of this amazing website - 
but also because our [team](https://nijmegenow.github.io/eurobrainmeeting2018/team/) are ready 
to serve you for research life in psychological & brain sciences.  

This year event will take place in summer capital of Netherlands - Nijmegen, a city situated on the Waal river, close to German border. 
Nijmegen is the oldest city in the Netherlands, the first to be recognized as such in Roman times, and in 2005 celebrated 2,000 years of existence.
Today Nijmegen is thriving, largely because of its lively student population and its status as a hub for political activism. 

So should you also be excited? Well yes... and here's why!

* **Attendance**: we're expecting attendees from different institutes
* **Topic**: more than 48 hours of psychological & brain sciences 
* **Date**: 20-21 of October
* **Venue**: to be determined, but in Nijmegen
* **Speakers**: we're in the process of finalising the list of speakers

but we've already secured a first batch of experts:

* **Name** - Description<br>
